		There are a great many species of spiders, yet people fear most of them. Spiders are fast and creepy, synonymous with sinister things. 
		<br>
		There is of course, precedent for this. Many spiders are venomous, sometimes even to a lethal degree, so our fear of them is often rooted an innate instinct to keep away from danger.
		<br>
		However, there are several species that are harmless. For example, jumping spiders!

		<br>
		Now, you might think that jumping spiders are even worse, because they're just regular spiders with even more mobility. But that's not entirely the case.
		<br>
		While jumping spiders are still wild creatures driven by instinct like any other spider, most are harmless to humans, and they are also quite intelligent for their size.
		<br>
		Jumping spiders have proven to be observant, with simple problem-solving skills and some innate curiosity. They've even been shown to exibit individual personalities, based on a study in 2015!

		I hope I've helped to give you another perspective on spiders! I implore you to do some more research, spiders are quite fascinating creatures if only you can get past that fear of them.
